   - Access analytics dashboard
   - Schedule sessions
   - Delete clients

2. **Coach**
   - View assigned clients
   - Update client progress
   - Schedule sessions
   - Track client metrics

### Implementation Details

- Authentication is handled via JWT tokens
- Role verification middleware (`authenticateTo`)
- Role-specific route protection
- Hierarchical permission structure
